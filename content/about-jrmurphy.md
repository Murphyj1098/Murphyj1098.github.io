Hello!

I'm Joe Murphy, a computer engineering researcher focusing on emulation and
virtualization of wireless communication networks for study. I currently work at
Worcester Polytechnic Institute, as a full-time Research Associate.

This site serves as a place for me to write about things I find interesting, what work I'm up to on
a more daily basis, and anything else I feel like writing about.
