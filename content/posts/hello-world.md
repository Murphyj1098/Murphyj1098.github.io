After months of saying "I should really set up some sort of portfolio or personal website", I
finally got around to setting up a text-based vlog (maybe I'll coin the term tlog). I mostly plan
to use this as a place to ramble about whatever I'm currently working on and showing off some cool
stuff I make or find.

The first order of business is this blog itself. Thanks to the power of GitHub Pages hosting,
a static site generator ([Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)), and a good looking theme
([hermit-v2](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hermit-v2/)), all I have to do to write new articles is
create some Markdown documents. While this does not feed the part of me that craves self-hosting
literally anything and everything, it does mean I don't have to have any understanding of web-based
development.

I look forward to sharing my thoughts here, and at a minimum the site can serve as an outlet for me
to ramble at about whatever I want. Here's hoping it lasts more than a week!
